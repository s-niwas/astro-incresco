. Little did we know that this partnership when it started couple of years ago would lead to something extraordinary.

Fast forward to today, and we are thrilled to announce that the PlanetSIM has won the coveted Proptech Mobile App of the Year Award! It's a true testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and pushing boundaries in pursuit of a common goal.

# How it all started

It was one the Weekday, late in the evening, Thiru (who was Head of Digital at Planet Smart City back then) called to discuss about building a mobile app for Planet Smart City, which aims to improve the quality of life of Residents, Management Committee members, Facility Managers and Staff by integrating sustainable solutions, enabled through smart and easy-to-use technology.

At the early stages of Incresco, we were eager to expand our portfolio and add a diverse range of domains. When Planet Smart City approached us with their fully integrated IoT solution, we knew we wanted to be a part of it. We were immediately onboarded and excited to bring our expertise to the project.

We presented the idea of building app with React and React Native tech stack with a single code base for both mobile and web, with an architecture designed for extensibility. 

# From Dangerous Climbs to Easy Control
The app features multiple ways to improvise and make the society smarter with automated lights, fully automated water solutions, air quality checks, and many others, it's the purpose-driven nature of the app that makes it truly special.

It goes beyond just making the jobs of security guards and administrators easier. One story in particular touched us deeply. In one society, security guards and admins had to "climb" over 15+ towers with no railing safety, four times a day, just to check the water status in the water tanks. 
With the fully integrated IoT solution, they can now see the status of each water tank, turn it on or off, and even schedule timings, all through a simple and easy-to-use interface from their desk or wherever they are.

This solution is especially impactful in India, where a significant percentage of security guards are in the mid or mid+ age range and may not be tech-savvy. 

# A step towards sustainability

As a company committed to sustainability, Planet Smart City was constantly exploring ways to reduce waste and increase efficiency. During a leadership meeting, there was a discussion about installing water-saving aerators as part of their onboarding process, highlighting their attention to detail and focus on sustainability.

The Planet SIM platform offers significant value that can be measured over time. Here are just a few examples:

1.  **Manpower** – With the traditional method, a designated person had to manually check the water levels, this approach was time-consuming, expensive, and inefficient. With the Planet SIM's app and level sensors, this process is streamlined and automated, and saving society the associated costs.
    
2.  **Electricity** – The installation of the SIM platform optimizes pump operation timing, reducing energy consumption by up to 5% or more and lowering the associated costs.
    
3.  **Water wastage and damages** – The integration of sensors and the Planet SIM app helps in providing and analyzing data for anomalies, indicating potential leakages. By identifying and fixing leaks early, this could help to reduce the cost of wasted water and long-term damage repairs.

# The recognition 
Being the proud tech partners for Planet Smart City, we extend our appreciation and regards to the achievements of the company. It is not just the recognition as Proptech Mobile app of the year, but is has revolutionized the way people interact with their homes and communities by offering seamless integration with smart solutions.
